# N-Queens
N-Queens is a puzzle-solving problem involving the placement of N chess queens on an N by N grid so that no two queens threaten each other. 
Solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 or n = 3. While there are many different ways to represent and solve this problem, 
the most efficient method is to model it as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) using a minimum-conflict heuristic.
